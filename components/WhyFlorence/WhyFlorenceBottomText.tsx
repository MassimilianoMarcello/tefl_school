        What is it that makes <span>Florence one of the most beautiful cities in the
        world</span>? Is it the stunning terracotta capped Duomo or the abundance of
        cozy cafés? Perhaps it’s the world-famous sculptures of <span>Piazza Della  Signoria</span>
        or maybe the vibrant outdoor markets. It’s your choice!
        Centuries ago Florence was home for one of the most famous and infamous
        families of Italy, <span>The Medici</span>, and their influence is omnipresent. The
       <span> Uffizi Gallery</span>, <span>The Pitti Palace</span>, <span>The Boboli Gardens</span>, <span>The Belvedere</span>, and
        the aptly named <span>Palazzo Medici</span> were all built during their days. And
        don’t forget about the plethora of markets available in Florence.
        Whether you enjoy shopping for clothing, fresh vegetables, or antiques,
        you’ll find it all here in our city. After you’ve had your fill of the
        markets, then take a walk in the historic center and relax at one of the
        cafés in one of the famous squares such as Piazza Della Signoria or
        Piazza Duomo. A TEFL Tuscany EFL / ESL teacher-training course is a very
        rewarding experience, and when you match it with a 4-week stay in
        Florence it becomes truly unforgettable. If you have any questions at
        all about the program please don’t hesitate to contact our Program
        Coordinators today.     </p>
